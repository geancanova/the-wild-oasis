# The Wild Oasis

Main project developed in the amazing [Ultimate React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course) by Jonas Schmedtmann.

This project uses several tools from the React ecosystem, like:

- Context API
- Styled Components
- React Router
- React Query
- React Hook Form
- Recharts

Some advanced React patterns were also used, such as Render Props Pattern, Higher-Order Components (HOC), Compound Components and React Portal.

The backend was built on top of [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
